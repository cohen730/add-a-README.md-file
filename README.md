## My name is Sarah Cohen! 
#### I am about to graduate from the **U of MN** with my **_BFA in Graphic Design!_** I hope to work at an agency and do cool designy things. 
#### I would like to become one of the following: 
#### 1. packaging artist
#### 2. logo designer
#### 3. illustrator
#### 4. graphic artist

###### Currently, I am really enjoying my free time since my sister got married on August 29th. I was her maid of honor and I helped plan **90%** of that wedding (invites, website, save the dates, bridesmaids dresses, flowers, etc.) I feel like I have breathing room! In my free time, I love cooking, trying new restaurants, playing video games, and drawing.
